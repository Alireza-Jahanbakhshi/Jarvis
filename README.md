# `Jarvis AI Assistant`

Jarvis is a Python-based AI assistant that can recognize voice commands and search for information on Wikipedia. It uses the pyttsx3, speechrecognition, and wikipedia libraries to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

## `Installation`

To run this program, you will need to install the following packages:

- pyttsx3
- speechrecognition
- wikipedia

You can install these packages using pip. Open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following command:

```
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia
```

You will also need to install PyAudio, which is used by the speechrecognition library to record audio from the microphone. To install PyAudio, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. You can download it from the official website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019. Make sure to select "C++ build tools" during the installation.
2. Install PyAudio using pip. Run the following command in the command prompt or terminal window:

```
pip install pyaudio
```

## `Usage`

To use the Jarvis AI assistant, run the following command in the command prompt or terminal window:

```
python Jarvis.py
```

This will start the program and the assistant will greet you. You can then ask the assistant to search for information on Wikipedia by saying "Wikipedia" followed by your query. For example, if you say "Wikipedia Python programming language", the assistant will search for information on Python programming language on Wikipedia and read the summary to you.

To exit the program, say "quit" or press Ctrl+C in the command prompt or terminal window.
